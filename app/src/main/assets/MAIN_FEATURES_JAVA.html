<h2><u>Main Features Of Java</u></h2>
<h3>Java is an Object Oriented language</h3>
<p>Object oriented programming is a way of organizing programs as collection of objects, each of which represents an instance of a class.</p>
<p>4 main concepts of Object Oriented programming are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a title="OOPs in Java- Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction" href="https://beginnersbook.com/2013/03/oops-in-java-encapsulation-inheritance-polymorphism-abstraction/" rel="noopener">Abstraction</a></li>
<li><a title="Encapsulation in Java with example" href="https://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/encapsulation-in-java/">Encapsulation</a></li>
<li><a title="Types of inheritance in Java: Single,Multiple,Multilevel &amp; Hybrid" href="https://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/java-inheritance-types/">Inheritance</a></li>
<li><a title="Polymorphism in Java &ndash; Method Overloading and Overriding" href="https://beginnersbook.com/2013/03/polymorphism-in-java/">Polymorphism</a></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="color: #339966;">Simple</span></h3>
<p>Java is considered as one of simple language because it does not have complex features like Operator overloading,&nbsp;<a href="https://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/java-multiple-inheritance/">Multiple inheritance</a>, pointers and Explicit memory allocation.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #339966;">Robust Language</span></h3>
<p>Robust means reliable. Java programming language is developed in a way that puts a lot of emphasis on early checking for possible errors, that&rsquo;s why java compiler is able to detect errors that are not easy to detect in other programming languages. The main features of java that makes it robust are garbage collection, Exception Handling and memory allocation.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #339966;">Secure</span></h3>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have pointers and we cannot access out of bound arrays (you get ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if you try to do so) in java. That&rsquo;s why several security flaws like stack corruption or buffer overflow is impossible to exploit in Java.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #339966;">Java is distributed</span></h3>
<p>Using java programming language we can create distributed applications. RMI(Remote Method Invocation) and EJB(Enterprise Java Beans) are used for creating distributed applications in java. In simple words: The java programs can be distributed on more than one systems that are connected to each other using internet connection. Objects on one JVM (java virtual machine) can execute procedures on a remote JVM.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #339966;">Multithreading</span></h3>
<p>Java supports&nbsp;<a title="Multithreading in java with examples" href="https://beginnersbook.com/2013/03/multithreading-in-java/">multithreading</a>. Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilisation of CPU.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #339966;">Portable</span></h3>
<p>As discussed above, java code that is written on one machine can run on another machine. The platform independent byte code can be carried to any platform for execution that makes java code portable.</p>
