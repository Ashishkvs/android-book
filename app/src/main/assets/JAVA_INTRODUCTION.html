<h2><u>Java Introduction</u></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in 1991,&nbsp;later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It was developed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton. It is a simple programming language. &nbsp;Writing, compiling and debugging a program is easy in java.&nbsp; It helps to create modular programs and reusable code.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Java terminology</strong></h3>
<div class="pc11 imgMax-590">
<p>Before we start learning Java, lets get familiar with common java terms.</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</strong></span><br />This is generally referred as JVM. Before, we discuss about JVM lets see the phases of program execution. Phases are as follows: we write the program, then we compile the program and at last we run the program.<br />1) Writing of the program is of course done by java programmer like you and me.<br />2) Compilation of program is done by javac compiler, javac is the primary java compiler included in java development kit (JDK). It takes java program as input and generates java bytecode as output.<br />3) In third phase, JVM executes the bytecode generated by compiler. This is called program run phase.</p>
<p>So, now that we understood that the primary function of JVM is to execute the bytecode produced by compiler.&nbsp;<strong>Each operating system has different JVM, however the output they produce after execution of bytecode is same across all operating systems</strong>. That is why we call java as platform independent language.</p>

<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>bytecode</strong></span><br />As discussed above, javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. The bytecode is saved in a .class file by compiler.</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Java Development Kit(JDK)</strong></span><br />While explaining JVM and bytecode, I have used the term JDK. Let&rsquo;s discuss about it. As the name suggests this is complete java development kit that includes JRE (Java Runtime Environment), compilers and various tools like JavaDoc, Java debugger etc.<br />In order to create, compile and run Java program you would need JDK installed on your computer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Java Runtime Environment(JRE)</strong></span><br />JRE is a part of JDK which means that JDK includes JRE. When you have JRE installed on your system, you can run a java program however you won&rsquo;t be able to compile it. JRE includes JVM, browser plugins and applets support. When you only need to run a java program on your computer, you would only need JRE.</p>
